## 2026-01-15 - US-001

- Created `packages/sdk/src/generate.ts` with AI-only skill generation
- Implemented `generateSkillWithAI(repoPath, repoName, options)` function
- Implemented `installSkill(repoName, skillContent, meta)` function
- Uses `streamPrompt()` from `ai/opencode.ts` with `analyze` agent
- Single comprehensive prompt instructs AI to use Read/Grep/Glob tools
- Returns `{ skillContent, commitSha }` for generated skills
- Supports provider, model, onDebug, onStream options
- Updated `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` with new patterns

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/generate.ts` (new)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- Reusing `streamPrompt()` from existing opencode.ts avoids duplication
- `toSkillDirName()` and `toMetaDirName()` duplicated from pipeline.ts (intentional - pipeline.ts will be deleted in later stories)
- Simpler output structure: SKILL.md + meta.json only (no references/ subdirectory needed for AI-only approach)
- Pre-existing test failures in SDK don't block typecheck

## 2026-01-15 - US-002

- Exported `installSkill` and `generateSkillWithAI` from `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`
- Added type exports: `GenerateSkillOptions`, `GenerateSkillResult`, `InstallSkillMeta`
- Updated AGENTS.md with export pattern documentation

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` (updated)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- `installSkill` was already fully implemented in US-001, just needed export from index.ts
- Keep `installSkillWithReferences` export for backward compatibility until analysis/ directory is deleted
