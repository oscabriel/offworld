## 2026-01-15 - US-001

- Created `packages/sdk/src/generate.ts` with AI-only skill generation
- Implemented `generateSkillWithAI(repoPath, repoName, options)` function
- Implemented `installSkill(repoName, skillContent, meta)` function
- Uses `streamPrompt()` from `ai/opencode.ts` with `analyze` agent
- Single comprehensive prompt instructs AI to use Read/Grep/Glob tools
- Returns `{ skillContent, commitSha }` for generated skills
- Supports provider, model, onDebug, onStream options
- Updated `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` with new patterns

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/generate.ts` (new)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- Reusing `streamPrompt()` from existing opencode.ts avoids duplication
- `toSkillDirName()` and `toMetaDirName()` duplicated from pipeline.ts (intentional - pipeline.ts will be deleted in later stories)
- Simpler output structure: SKILL.md + meta.json only (no references/ subdirectory needed for AI-only approach)
- Pre-existing test failures in SDK don't block typecheck

## 2026-01-15 - US-002

- Exported `installSkill` and `generateSkillWithAI` from `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`
- Added type exports: `GenerateSkillOptions`, `GenerateSkillResult`, `InstallSkillMeta`
- Updated AGENTS.md with export pattern documentation

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` (updated)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- `installSkill` was already fully implemented in US-001, just needed export from index.ts
- Keep `installSkillWithReferences` export for backward compatibility until analysis/ directory is deleted

## 2026-01-15 - US-003

- Deleted `packages/sdk/src/analysis/` directory (12 files)
- Removed analysis exports from `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`
- Deleted orphaned validation files: `consistency.ts`, `quality.ts` (depended on analysis types)
- Deleted test files importing analysis/: `analysis.test.ts`, `parsers.test.ts`, `pipeline.integration.test.ts`
- Updated AGENTS.md - removed obsolete analysis sections, added deletion learnings

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/analysis/` (deleted - 12 files)
- `packages/sdk/src/validation/consistency.ts` (deleted)
- `packages/sdk/src/validation/quality.ts` (deleted)
- `packages/sdk/src/__tests__/analysis.test.ts` (deleted)
- `packages/sdk/src/__tests__/parsers.test.ts` (deleted)
- `packages/sdk/src/__tests__/pipeline.integration.test.ts` (deleted)
- `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` (updated)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- validation/consistency.ts and quality.ts imported from analysis/ but were not exported from validation/index.ts - dead code
- Test files that directly import deleted modules must be deleted, not refactored
- Cascade deletions: when removing a module, check what else imports it (grep for import patterns)
- 6600+ lines deleted - significant reduction in SDK complexity

## 2026-01-15 - US-004

- Deleted `packages/sdk/src/ast/` directory (3 files)
- No import cleanup needed - analysis/ was the only consumer

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/ast/` (deleted - 3 files: parser.ts, patterns.ts, index.ts)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- Clean deletion when dependent module already removed - no cascade effects
- ~1100 lines deleted
- AST parsing was tightly coupled to analysis/ - removing analysis/ first made this trivial

---

## 2026-01-15 - US-005

- Deleted `packages/sdk/src/validation/` directory (3 files)
- Removed validation exports from `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`
- Deleted `validation.test.ts` test file

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sdk/src/validation/` (deleted - 3 files: staleness.ts, paths.ts, index.ts)
- `packages/sdk/src/__tests__/validation.test.ts` (deleted)
- `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` (updated)
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (updated)

**Learnings:**
- consistency.ts and quality.ts were already deleted in US-003 (depended on analysis/ types)
- Only staleness.ts, paths.ts, index.ts remained after US-003
- ~400 lines deleted
- Validation was only used for deterministic analysis caching - not needed for AI-only approach
