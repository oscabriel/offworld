- Replaced Better Auth config with WorkOS JWT validation
- Files changed: `packages/backend/convex/auth.config.ts`
- **Learnings:**
  - Two JWT issuers needed: SSO (`https://api.workos.com/`) and User Management (`https://api.workos.com/user_management/${clientId}`)
  - Both issuers share the same JWKS endpoint: `https://api.workos.com/sso/jwks/${clientId}`
  - WORKOS_CLIENT_ID must be available at module evaluation time (top-level throw if missing)

- Removed betterAuth component from convex.config.ts
- Files changed: `packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts`
- **Learnings:**
  - defineApp() can be called empty - no components needed for basic Convex auth
  - WorkOS JWT validation handled entirely by auth.config.ts, not by components
