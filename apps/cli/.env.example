# Optional overrides for local development
# Copy this file to .env to override the hardcoded production values
#
# Production URLs are hardcoded in the SDK source code.
# These env vars are only needed if you want to test against
# a different backend (e.g., local Convex dev deployment).

# WorkOS OAuth Client ID (overrides production client ID)
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID="your_dev_workos_client_id"

# Convex deployment URL (overrides production URL)
CONVEX_URL="https://your-dev-deployment.convex.cloud"
